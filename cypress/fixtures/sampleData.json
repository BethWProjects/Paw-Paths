        "Easy parking. Gentle elevation. Three miles round trip. And a ghost town? The Mayflower Gulch Trail gives you all this and a shockingly gorgeous basin to behold. On top of all this, the hike works well for families, especially if there exists any curiosity about the old west. The spacious gulch invites visitors to wander around and discover the fringes…a running stream, abandoned mines, and ridge line views. Caution: DO NOT inspect abandoned mines or even walk too closely; enjoy them from a distance! They can have unstable internal structures and entrances.",

        "Eleven Mile State Park feels like the proverbial `hidden in plain sight` gem. Situated off the commonly traveled Highway 24 between Colorado Springs and Buena Vista, this loop hike blesses visitors with uncommon beauty. Trekking around the 3.5+ mile trail serves up a superb buffet of Colorado's classic outdoors: aspen and evergreen forests, meadows, rocky crags, vistas of mountain ranges, and a shoreline. Rarely do trails achieve a true `all-year` rating, but this loop qualifies. This hike near Denver could function as an along-the-way pit stop or a destination in itself, perfect for a swift pace or a lingering stroll with the family.",

Long considered an iconic range, the Indian Peaks give hikers an endless stream of prime photography, wildflowers, and `Look at that!` moments. From the trailhead to Mirror Lake hikers encounter a half-dozen waterfalls, any one of which would capture all-star status on another trail!",
