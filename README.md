# 🐾 Paw Paths

## Overview
Welcome to Paw Paths! Here we have provided an app that allows you to browse a collection of hikes and parks, search for specific type, and view individual details of a path. This is a group project assigned by [Turing School of Software and Design](https://frontend.turing.edu/). This was a path tracking application which introduced students to Express, Knex, and PostgresQL as well as strengthening an understanding of React and Cypress; taking place over 9 days to complete. Our learning goals were to implement a 'Stretch Technologies', which we chose to be BE and Databases. View the project here: [Link to project description](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/stretch.html).
