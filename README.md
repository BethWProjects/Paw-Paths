# üçè Sour Apples

## Overview
Welcome to Sour Apples! Here we have provided an app that allows you to browse a collection of movies, search for specific movies by title, and view individual details of a movie on a separate page. This is a paired project assigned by [Turing School of Software and Design](https://frontend.turing.edu/). This was a movie tracking application introduced students to React and Cypress; taking place over 10 days to complete. Our learning goals were to implement React fundamentals, testing React components and asynchronous JS, refactoring, and creating a multi-page UX using Router.
