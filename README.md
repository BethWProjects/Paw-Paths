# 🐾 Paw Paths

## Overview
Welcome to Paw Paths! Here we have provided an app that allows you to browse a collection of hikes and parks, search for a specific type, and view individual details of a path. This is a group project assigned by [Turing School of Software and Design](https://frontend.turing.edu/). It is a path tracking application which introduced students to Express, Knex, and PostgresQL as well as strengthening an understanding of React and Cypress; taking place over 9 days to complete. Our learning goal was to implement a 'Stretch Technology', which we chose to be backend, learning to build a database and create a table schema with seeded data. We were able to deploy our backend API on Heroku, connecting to the PostgresQL database, and then fetch the data with the provided link on our frontend. View the project specs here: [project description](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/stretch.html).
